More recently, his research "Religious, Frustrated, and a Long Way from Home: Religiously-Active International Students and Academicians' Responses to Religion" was published in the 2017 edited volume Christianity and the Secular Border Patrol: The Loss of Judeo-Christian Knowledge. His most recent book is Developing Redemptive Change Agents: Discipleship That Helps Nations Flourish Rather Than Flounder.
