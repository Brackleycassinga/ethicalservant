                  Valeria Elliott is a Latino educator and social entrepreneur with over 20 years of experience developing culturally responsive professional programs serving Latino communities. Currently an Online Course Facilitator at Cornell University in the Bank of America Institute for Women's Entrepreneurship, she mentors women startup founders globally while pioneering innovative educational platforms that bridge cultural identity with professional advancement. Elliott founded the first comprehensive "Lawyering in Spanish and Latin American Initiatives" program in the United States at the University of Denver Sturm College of Law (2003-2010), where she created international internship networks across Latin America and Spain and established the Spanish Section of the Colorado Bar Association. Her bilingual legal services work included coordinating pro bono programs and developing continuing legal education curricula used by over 500 attorneys in the Denver Metro area. Elliott's entrepreneurial ventures focus on transforming traditional language learning through culturally responsive storytelling. As founder of Spanish Inspired (2024-present), she created a platform where professionals learn Spanish through authentic Latino narratives, challenging grammar-heavy methods that lack cultural relevance. Her previous venture, Mokovi (2013-2018), earned her the prestigious Small Business Administration InnovateHer award for "most innovative business improving women's lives." Currently completing her Ph.D. in Latin American, Caribbean and U.S. Latino Studies at the University of Albany (expected December 2025), Elliott serves on the International Advisory Council of the Freire Institute at the University of Lancashire. Her work has been featured in U.S. News and World Report, National Law Journal, and international publications across Latin America.
